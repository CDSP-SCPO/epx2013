<P>The Council held a public debate - transmitted by TV - on the Dutch Presidency's programme in the ECOFIN domain and the Commission programme for 1997 in the same area.
<P>The President of the Council, when presenting his programme, laid particular emphasis on the continuation of work regarding the implementation of Phase III of EMU on the basis of the results of the "Dublin" Summit, on efforts for enhancing cooperation within the ECOFIN Council to stimulate employment, the fight against fraud and sound financial management, continued budgetary discipline, as well as carrying forward work in the areas of taxation and financial services.
<P>In his intervention Mr SANTER presented the various aspects of the Commission programme underlining in particular that these coincided largely with the Presidency's priorities outlined by Mr ZALM.
<P>The debate gave Ministers the opportunity to formulate their observations and comments on these programmes.  Ministers welcomed the ambitious thrust of both programmes and assured the Presidency and the Commission of their full support for implementing them.  Ministers paid special attention to the issue of tax competition and to the need of maintaining strict budgetary discipline also at EU level.
<P><B><U>EURO COINS</U></B>
<P>The Council took note of information given by Commissioner de SILGUY on the state of work concerning the euro coin design competition and in particular on the appointment of a European Jury by the Commission.  In relation to the choice of designs, the Council will make its selection in May on the basis of the work of the European Jury and public consultations.
<P>As far as the work of the Mint Directors is concerned, the Council noted that their report from November of last year including suggestions concerning technical specifications (face value, representations, diameter, thickness, weight, colour, composition, edge and shape) meets the approval of a broad majority in the Council.
<P>The Council asked the Mint Directors to pursue their work, especially in relation to the questions raised in their report dealing with edge lettering and latent image, storage and distribution, collector coins and precious metal bullion coins, as well as the further reduction of the nickel content of coins, the use of a heptagonal coin in vending machines, and the necessary security guarantees, points which were raised during the debate.
<P><B><U>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE</U></B>
<P>With regard to the macro-financial assistance of 200 MECU to Ukraine decided in 1995, the Council agreed that the conditions were now fulfilled enabling the Commission to release the second instalment of 100 MECU.
<P>The Council also agreed on the principle of a further loan to this country and invited the Commission to study further the matter, as far as the amount and precise conditions are concerned, and present it with a formal proposal.
<P><B><U>NEW EIB LENDING MANDATES FOR CEECs, MED, ALA AND SA</U></B> (*)(*) Central and Eastern European Countries,  Mediterranean countries, Asia and Latin America, South Africa.
<P><B>- <U>COUNCIL CONCLUSIONS</U></B>
<P>"The Council considers that the Commission proposal on new lending mandates for CEECs, MED, ALA and SA is an adequate basis for agreement, subject to the consideration of the forthcoming opinion of the European Parliament, with the following additional elements :
<OL><LI>. The level of guarantee is set at 70%.
<LI>2. The Commission proposal for the Mediterranean envelope will be increased by 210 MECU up to a level of 2310 MECU.
<LI>3. The Commission proposal for the CEECs envelope will be increased by 70 MECU up to a level of 3520 MECU.  In addition the Member States and the European Commission unanimously declare that they agree to the creation of a substantial pre-accession support facility.  They invite the European Investment Bank to propose such a facility to the Board of Governors later this year.  The facility will enter into force as soon as possible in the light of future accession.  The facility will be approved under Art. 18 of the EIB statute and carry no guarantee from the Community budget or from the Member States.
<LI>4. Each payment to the loan guarantee fund will be based on the percentage required at the time of payment, that is 15% currently and 14% as soon as feasible.
<LI>5. The EIB lending envelopes covered by a Community guarantee are consistent with a provision of 1050 MECU for macro-financial assistance (MFA) assuming that 750 MECU is needed for EURATOM lending.  The maximum for MFA will be increased to 1200 MECU, if EURATOM lending in the period of consideration does not exceed 600 MECU.
<LI>6. The mandates will cover a period of three years starting on 31 January 1997 (except the one for South Africa which will start later); the ECOFIN Council asks the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to consult together in order to ensure that, in determining the rate at which the mandates are used, account will be taken of the annual fluctuations in the rate at which the EU is being asked to provide balance of payments support to third countries.
<LI>7. An evaluation of the decisions at hand will be made by the Council on the basis of a report by the Commission and the European Investment Bank, in the middle of 1998.
</OL><P>The Council notes the Commission's agreement to the above additional elements, which fully respect existing Community legislation and the Financial Perspectives."
<P><B><U>STRUCTURED DIALOGUE WITH CEECs - PRESIDENCY CONCLUSIONS</U></B>
<UL><LI>"1. Ministers of the Associated Countries met jointly with ECOFIN Ministers as part of the ongoing structured dialogue. They focused on "Medium-term budgetary policy in the EU and the associated countries". 
<LI> A discussion paper on this subject was prepared by the Commission and sent in advance to all participants. Hungary and Slovenia opened the discussion presenting their experience, followed by Finland and Portugal on the EU side. A number of other countries presented their views as well.
<LI>2. Ministers agreed that budgetary consolidation is an essential condition for sustained economic growth. The Member States have recognised this by including reference values for the sustainability of their budgetary positions in the Treaty and by redressing their budgetary policies accordingly in the run-up to EMU. Many of the associated countries have already taken the same line and have brought down their government deficits below the level of 3 percent of nominal GDP.
<LI>3. In several respects, the budgetary problems of the associated countries are similar to those of most Member States inter alia from the increased budgetary burden of social security caused by rising unemployment. In other respects, the situation for the associated countries is different, which as associated countries can be assumed to have a greater potential for economic growth as they get rid of the inefficiencies of the previous economic system. Ministers stressed medium-term frameworks for budgetary consolidation both for Member States and for associated countries.
<LI>4. Ministers reiterated that the Stability and Growth Pact, as it was agreed by the European Council in Dublin, provides an appropriate medium-term framework for budgetary policy in the Member States participating in the euro zone. The Dublin Council decided that Member States outside the euro zone would be required to provide a multi-annual framework for budgetary policy in their convergence programmes, similar to that contained in the stability programmes, but subject to non-binding recommendations.
<LI>5. The Ministers of the associated countries noted that they had made considerable progress in tackling their budgetary problems. They also noted however that the pension and social security systems and the upgrading of the infrastructure could become major burdens for the government budget. On the revenue side, many of the associated countries encounter difficulties in raising taxes.
<LI>6. Ministers referred to the provisions of the Treaty precluding monetary financing of deficits. The Ministers of the associated countries saw no reason why these rules could not be effectively adopted in their countries, although it was acknowledged that some countries might need more time to do so than others.
<LI>7. Ministers agreed that in their next meeting they will examine progress achieved in the reform of the financial markets and liberalization of capital movements in the associated countries, since they examined the issue in autumn 1995."

<UL><LI> Total product life cycle issues
<LI> Process issues
<LI> Strategy/planning/design tools
<LI> Human/organizational/social issues and
<LI> Virtual/extended enterprise issues
</UL><P>The cooperation will involve participation in projects by entities, in accordance with procedures adopted in common for the creation and operation of international consortia and may include visits, training and exchanges of scientists, engineers and other appropriate personnel for purposes relevant to the successful implementation and completion of the projects.
<P><I><B>ENERGY</B></I>
<P><B><U>Trans-European Energy Networks</U></B>
<P>The Council adopted the common position on the decision amending Decision 96/1254/EC laying down a series of guidelines on trans-European energy networks. The common position will be forwarded to the European Parliament ,with a view of its approval in accordance with the co-decision procedure.
<P>The decision aims at updating the indicative list of projects of common interest attached to the above-mentioned Decision by adding projects which have since reached an advanced stage of development and meet the criteria laid down in that decision.
<P><I><B>ENVIRONMENT</B></I>
<P><B><U>Ambient air pollution</U></B>
<P>The Council formally adopted the Decision establishing a reciprocal exchange of information and data from networks and individual stations measuring ambient air pollution within the Member States.
<P>The aim of this Decision is to replace the information exchange mechanism introduced by Decisions 75/442/EEC and 82/459/EEC by a mechanism consistent with the framework set by the air quality Directive 96/62/EC and suitable for the collection of the homogeneous data. The new mechanism will cover more pollutants and include data on the air-pollution monitoring networks and stations operating in the Member States as data aggregation and validation procedures. 
<P><I><B>CONSUMER AFFAIRS </B></I>
<P><B><U>Comparative advertising</U></B>
<P>The Council observed that it was unable to approve all of the European Parliament's amendments to its common position of 19 March 1996 concerning the proposal for a Directive amending Directive 84/450/EEC concerning misleading advertising so as to include comparative advertising.  The Conciliation Committee will therefore be convened pursuant to Article 189b of the Treaty.
<P><I><B>FREE MOVEMENT </B></I>
<P><B><U>Free movement of doctors and mutual recognition of their diplomas</U></B>
<P>The Council observed that it was unable to approve all of the European Parliament's amendments to its common position of 18 June 1996 concerning the proposed Directive amending Directive 93/16/EC to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications. The Conciliation Committee will therefore be convened pursuant to the Treaty provisions concerning co-decision (Article 189b).
<P><I><B>APPOINTMENT</B></I>
<P><B><U>Economic and Social Committee</U></B>
<P>The Council adopted a Decision appointing

<LI><I><B>CONSUMER AFFAIRS</B></I>
<LI><B><U>Distance contracts</U> *</B>
</UL><P>Further to the agreement reached on a joint text by the Conciliation Committee, the Council formally adopted on 23 January 1997 a Directive on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts; it did so by the written procedure and with the German delegation voting against.
