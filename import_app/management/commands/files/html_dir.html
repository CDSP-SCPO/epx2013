<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PRICES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND RELATED MEASURES FOR 1998/1999</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council had a first exchange of views on the Commission proposals concerning the 1998/1999 Agricultural Price Package. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate was introduced by Commissioner Fischler who stressed that, in view of the forthcoming reforms under the Agenda 2000 communication of July 1997, the proposals largely amount to a rollover of existing arrangements, with a few exceptions required for strictly legal reasons or to fulfil its prior commitments. He pointed out that the proposed price package is in line with the Commission's orientation towards a freeze of the agricultural budget for 1999 in comparison with 1998.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers gave their initial reaction to the proposals and raised a number of questions (notably the reduction in the level of aid for hemp and the freeze of the ceilings of special premiums in the beef sector) or mentioned aspects which, according to them, needed to be solved urgently (such as the rate of set aside for arable crops). A number of Ministers also mentioned specific sectors, notably milk, wine and olive oil, for which they felt reform was urgent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Council noted the preliminary observations made by Member States and instructed the Special Committee on Agriculture to examine the proposals in detail and report back as quickly as possible on the results in order to allow for a decision to be taken once the Opinion of the European Parliament is available.</P>

<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RAW TOBACCO : COMMON MARKET ORGANIZATION (CMO)</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council heard a presentation by Commissioner Fischler of the Commission's proposal to reform the common organization of the market in raw tobacco and held a first debate on the subject.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commissioner Fischler stressed that the proposal aims at directing tobacco production in the Union towards quality and market requirements while safeguarding, at the same time, its important socio-economic role in the producing regions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate, the vast majority of delegations agreed on the need for reform of the common market organization, although their positions varied considerably on the approach to be taken and on the extent of such a reform. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Council noted the preliminary responses of Member States and asked the Special Committee on Agriculture to examine the proposal further and report back as soon as possible on the results in order to allow for a decision to be taken once the Opinion of the European Parliament has been delivered.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BEEF AND VEAL : MEASURES TO PROMOTE QUALITY AND PUBLICIZE LABELLING</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council examined a Presidency compromise concerning the Commission's amended proposal for measures to promote quality and publicize the labelling of beef and veal.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the positions of delegations, the Council noted that agreement was not possible at this stage. Under these circumstances, the Presidency will reflect further on the follow up to be given to this dossier.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recalled that the proposal envisages a strengthening of the existing scheme to promote quality Community beef and veal as well as new measures to publicise to consumers the new labelling arrangements adopted by the Council in April 1997 and new measures to promote quality Community beef and veal in third countries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the European Parliament's Opinion, the Commission presented a modified proposal amending the original legal base (Article&nbsp;43 of the Treaty) by adding Article&nbsp;129a on consumer protection. As a consequence, in order to adopt the Regulation on the basis of Article 43 alone, the Council will have to act unanimously.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;assessed, on the basis of information given by Mr Fischler and by the Netherlands delegation, the progress achieved to date in the preparation of the OECD Ministerial Meeting of the Committee for Agriculture to be held in Paris on 5/6&nbsp;March 1998;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;underlined the importance of the above Meeting at a critical time in the run-up to important external negotiations, and the necessity to maintain a united front in support of the Commission;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;to this end, noted the reference made by most delegations to the Council conclusions of November 1997 on "Agenda 2000" which they consider a useful starting point;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;agreed to ensure appropriate and close Community coordination in preparation for the Ministerial meeting's final Communiqu&eacute;;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;noted that, to this effect, further Community coordination will be held in the presence of high-level officials in Brussels, on 23 February 1998.</P></DIR>

<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FUNCTIONING OF THE EWE PREMIUM : SECOND COMMISSION REPORT</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council took note of the Commission's report&nbsp;and of the positions adopted by a number of Member States on its conclusions. These stated in particular that, having evaluated the functioning of the ewe premium, the Commission did not consider it necessary to amend the basic Council regulation at this stage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Council noted that the Commission has endeavoured to find appropriate solutions, within its independent powers, to most of the concerns expressed by Member States with the exception of the requested introduction of a top-up premium for ewes as well as of regional quotas, to which the Commission remains firmly opposed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;took note of an interim report of the Special Committee on Agriculture concerning the Commission proposal amending Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 on the common organization of the market in bananas;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;had an exchange of views during which most delegations clarified and completed their positions on the subject;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;recognized that the reformed CMO for bananas must be WTO compatible; took note of the Commission's statement that its Legal Service considers it being the case; noted that, following the request of a number of delegations, the Legal Services of the Council will come forward with advice as soon as possible;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;noted that Member States have confirmed the aim of reaching a final decision before the end of June 1998, provided that the European Parliament's Opinion is available, the Presidency having noted the widespread readiness to work on the basis of the Commission proposal;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;instructed accordingly the Special Committee on Agriculture to continue speedily the detailed examination of the proposal, notably on such issues as:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;=&#9;the autonomous quota and proposed tariff rate,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;=&#9;licensing,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;=&#9;the situation of EU and ACP producers,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;=&#9;Fair Trade Bananas.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;asked for a report to be presented to the Council as soon as possible.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recalled that the proposal aims to bring the Community banana regime into line with the European Union's commitments vis-&agrave;-vis the World Trade Organization (WTO) before the 1 January 1999 deadline. In its new proposal, the Commission aims to maintain the tariff quota at its current level of 2,2&nbsp;million tonnes, and at the same rate of duty – currently ECU&nbsp;75/tonne; to set an additional autonomous tariff quota of 353&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes at a rate of ECU&nbsp;300/tonne in order to take account of the enlargement of the EU; to abolish the current provisions on import certificates and replace them by a system compatible with the WTO; to grant a share of the tariff quota to suppliers having a substantial interest and, consequently, not to allocate to individual countries shares within the total allocation to traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) suppliers. The Commission also intends, within its own sphere of competence, to ensure that the income of Community producers is maintained.</P>
