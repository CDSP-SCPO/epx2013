<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;RULES FOR PARTICIPATION</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Council adopted, by qualified majority, with the German delegation abstaining and the Portuguese delegation voting against, its common position on the decision concerning the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and for the dissemination of research results for the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme (EC). The text of the common position will be sent to the European Parliament for its second reading under the cooperation procedure.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Council also reached a unanimous political agreement on the decision concerning the rules of participation for the 5th Framework Programme (Euratom). The decision will be adopted together with the formal adoption of the decision concerning the EC programme.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;These rules are essential for the implementation of the 5th FPs (Framework Programmes). While laying down the rules for the participation and for the dissemination of research results, they ensure the transparency of the decisions taken in this context.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Both decisions are an extension and an adaptation of the rules laid down under the 4th&nbsp;FP. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;SPECIFIC PROGRAMMES OF THE 5TH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;- COUNCIL CONCLUSIONS</P>
</B><P>&#9;Pending the opinion of the European Parliament and a final decision on the Research Framework Programmes, the Council had an extremely fruitful discussion on the proposals for the specific programmes of the Fifth Framework Programme. </P>
<P>&#9;In the course of this discussion, the Council reached a consensus on the content of three specific programmes: the User-friendly Information Society; the Nuclear Energy Research Programme; the horizontal programme on Promoting Innovation and Participation of SMEs, as well as on the general provisions which are standard to all programmes. These texts will be subject to review in the light of the final decision on the Framework Programme, and the content of all the specific programmes taking account of the opinion of the European Parliament.</P>
<P>&#9;The Council also took note of progress on the distribution of funds within the different specific programmes. In this context also, the Council addressed the question of administrative costs. The Council takes note of the Commission's proposal and rationale for an overall figure of 1092 MECUs (7.2% of the total for indirect actions) for administrative costs, based on an overall amount for the Fifth Framework Programme of 16.3 billion ECUs. It considers that, whatever overall amount is agreed for the Framework Programme, the maximum needed for administrative costs should be less than the 7.8% of the total budget for indirect actions which was allocated under the Fourth Framework Programme. The allocation will be reviewed once the final overall amount and the detailed content of the specific programmes is known, and in the light of further justification from the Commission.</P>
<P>&#9;The Council invites the Permanent Representatives Committee to continue work on the Commission's proposals, in the light of the opinion of the European Parliament on the specific programmes and the final decision on the content and overall amount of the Framework Programme, with a view to enabling the Council to adopt all the specific programmes by the end of the year, thereby enabling the Framework Programme to become operational, as planned, in 1999.</P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- <U>COUNCIL CONCLUSIONS</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;The Council, in the context of its deliberations on the specific programmes of the Fifth Framework Programme, and on the basis of the conclusions agreed at its meeting on 10 November 1997 and in the light of the Ministerial discussions at an informal colloquium on 28 April 1998, considered the Commission's intentions for the implementation and management of the programmes. The Council recognizes that scientific excellence and good management must go hand in hand in order to ensure the delivery of an effective programme, complementing the activities carried out in the Member States, as provided in the Treaty.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;The Council welcomes the intention of the Commission to make further improvements building on those which have already been made. It believes an imaginative and continuous effort is necessary to develop further a flexible and transparent approach to management which will contribute to an efficient, user-friendly programme focused on strategic goals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;The Council broadly endorses the Commission's intention to:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;i)&#9; take account of relevant views in reaching a decision on any changes in the representative bodies of the scientific and industrial communities which provide advice on Community research activities as a whole;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;ii)&#9;set up rapidly, taking account of the views of the Member States, the external advisory groups (EAGs) to advise the Commission in particular on the content and direction of the key actions; the role of these advisory groups will be distinct from the steering and decision-making function of the specific programme committees;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;iii)&#9;enhance transparency in all aspects of programme implementation and management, including concerning the membership and advice of the EAGs and the membership of project evaluation panels once the evaluations have been completed;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;iv)&#9;examine ways and means further to improve the broad coordination of projects through measures appropriate to the activities concerned and in line with applicable procedures; and to study new, alternative, flexible methods of programme management which should take into account the specificity of the different parts of the 5th Framework Programme.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;v)&#9;speed up the procedures from the perspective of the participants and potential participants, including setting targets for reducing timescales for key administrative processes and drawing up a code of good practice;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&#9;vi)&#9;benchmark its performance in implementation and management against that of other research funding agencies; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;vii)&#9;improve the clarity and effectiveness of the evaluation of the programme's results and impact.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;The Council looks forward to further progress on these issues. It welcomes the Commission's undertaking to provide an annual report to Council on the progress made in meeting performance targets, adopting new management approaches and on plans for future improvements. The Council agrees to review progress made in delivering improvements in the implementation and management of the Framework Programme on a regular basis and for the first time in the second half of 1999.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;STRESSES that the above objective will be pursued actively, in particular in the fields of applications benefiting from space technologies and systems where the Commission has produced, or intends to produce, an Action Plan i.e. telecommunications, navigation and Earth observation;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;AGREES to take into account in these areas to the maximum extent possible the interests of the States which are Members of ESA but not Members of the European Community and to invite ESA to take reciprocal account of the interests of the States which are Members of the European Community but not Members of ESA and to make every effort to ensure that such States are not disadvantaged as compared to States which are Members of both organisations;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;CALLS ON the Commission to involve ESA, in the space applications referred to above, in the definition, revision and implementation of action plans and in its dialogue with the other actors in the space sector, so as to maximise the benefits of ESA and Community activities in support of the objectives of all Members States in the space field;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;ENCOURAGES the Commission to start implementing practical measures to promote synergy between the activities of ESA and the European Community while avoiding unnecessary duplication, focusing on the specific fields of applications referred to above and CALLS ON the Commission to take appropriate initiatives with a view to obtaining necessary decisions from the Council.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council adopted by qualified majority - with the Austrian and German delegations voting against and the Danish and Spanish delegations abstaining - the Directive providing for a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship (official title: Directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising of the tobacco products).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recalled that the European Parliament, at its second reading, did not adopt any amendments to the text of the common position adopted by the Council on 12 February 1998. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Directive provides for a ban on all forms of advertising&nbsp;() or sponsorship of tobacco products within the Community, to be phased in subject to certain conditions and certain limits. However, it takes the form of a minimum directive, thereby enabling Member States to retain and/or introduce any stricter requirements they consider necessary to ensure the protection of public health.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Member States must transpose the Directive into their respective national laws no later than 3 years following its publication.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as<B><I> indirect advertising</B></I> is concerned, the ban applies under the following conditions:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">–&#9;a Member State may allow a brand name already used in good faith for both tobacco products and other goods or services, traded or offered for sale by the same undertaking or by different undertakings, prior to the date of publication of the Directive, to be used for advertising the other goods or services. However, that name may only be used in a manner clearly distinct from that used for the tobacco product, without any further distinguishing mark already used for a tobacco product.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">–&#9;Member States shall ensure that no tobacco product bears the brand name, trademark, emblem or other distinctive feature of any other product or service, unless the tobacco product has already been traded under that brand name or trademark or with these attributes by the deadline set for transposition, namely 3 years following publication of the Directive in the Official Journal.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The ban on advertising may not be circumvented for any product or service placed on the market as from the abovementioned date, by the use of brand names, trademarks, emblems and other distinguishing marks already used for a tobacco product.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;For this reason, the brand name, trademark, emblem or other distinctive feature of the product or service must be presented in a manner clearly distinct from that used for the tobacco product.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to actual advertising , any <B><I>free distribution</B></I> with the aim or direct or indirect effect of promoting a tobacco product is banned.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scope of the ban does not extend to certain areas or specific cases which remain subject to national regulations:</P><DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">–&#9;Non-Community publications</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Directive does not apply to the sale on Member States' territories of publications containing advertising for tobacco products which are published and printed in third countries, where those publications are not principally intended for the Community market.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">–&#9;Trade communications</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Communications intended exclusively for professionals in the tobacco trade are authorized.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">–<B>&#9;Tobacco sales outlets</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The display of tobacco products for sale, an indication of their prices and advertising aimed at the buyer are authorized inside establishments specializing in the sale of tobacco products and on their shop fronts or, in the case of establishments selling a variety of goods and services, at locations reserved for the sale of tobacco products, and at sales outlets which, in Greece, are subject to special licensing arrangements for social purposes (known as "periptera");</P></DIR>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sponsorship</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beyond the 3-year deadline for transposition, Member States may postpone implementation of the Directive by one more year in respect of advertising in the written press, and by 2 more years in respect of sponsorship.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in exceptional cases or for duly justified reasons, Member States may continue to authorize the existing sponsorship of events or activities organized at world level for a further period of 3 years (in addition to the 2 years referred to in the previous paragraph) provided that:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">=&#9;the sums devoted to such sponsorship decrease during the transitional period;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">=&#9;voluntary-restraint measures are introduced in order to reduce the visibility of advertising at the events concerned.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the case, this last transitional period will end no later than 1 October 2006, the date by which all the requirements of the Directive will apply.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission will submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee not later than 3 years following publication of the Directive and subsequently every two years, a report on the implementation of this Directive, with particular reference to the implementation and effects of the provisions on indirect advertising and sponsorship. Where appropriate, it will submit proposals for adapting this Directive to the developments identified in these reports.</P>
