<P><A NAME="_Toc528473876">EMPLOYMENT PACKAGE AND WAYS OF INCREASING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND PROLONGING WORKING LIFE</A></P>
</B></U>
<P>The Council heard a presentation by Commissioner SOLBES on the Employment package of 14&nbsp;September&nbsp;2001 which includes a draft Joint Employment Report by the Council and the Commission on the employment situation, a proposal for a Council Decision on guidelines for Member States' employment policies for the year 2002 and a Council Recommendation on the implementation of Member States' employment policies.</P>

<P>The Council also heard a report – well received by delegations – by the Chairman of the Economic Policy Committee (EPC) on the preliminary work undertaken by his Committee on the employment package.  The EPC Chairman also referred to the EPC's first debate on a Commission note on increasing employment levels and prolonging working life.  He said that some delegations wanted to steer the debate more particularly towards aspects on which Member States could actually take action and referred to certain differences of opinion between the delegations on the Commission texts, particularly with regard to the application of the principle of subsidiarity.</P>

<P>The Council instructed the EPC to continue with preparation of a joint report with the Standing Committee on Employment on the employment package, which, once completed, would be forwarded to the Employment and Social Policy Council.</P>

<P>It also instructed the EPC to continue working on ways of increasing employment levels and prolonging working life on the basis of a new draft report to be produced by the Commission next month.  This report should be submitted to the Barcelona European Council  in the spring of 2002.  An interim report on the subject was expected by early 2002 at the latest.</P>

<P>–&#9;a questionnaire on the supervision of IORPs had been drawn up by the Presidency and sent to the Member States on 3 September 2001 with the aim of improving mutual understanding of the systems of supervision to which IORPs were subject in the Member States; replies were currently being analysed.</P>

<P>Ministers welcomed this result, underlining the importance of this Directive in combating the financing of terrorism, and expressed their determination to see it transposed into national law at the earliest opportunity.</P>

<B><U><P><A NAME="_Toc528473880">ACTIONS TO COMBAT THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM</A></P>
</B></U>
<P>In accordance with the conclusions of the informal ECOFIN Council meeting in Li&egrave;ge, the Council heard two reports, one from the Presidency and one from the Commission on the action to be taken in the ECOFIN area to combat terrorism.  The Presidency's report specifically covers the following four points:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;progress of the investigations carried out by the securities commissions on the possible manipulations of exchange rates and insider trading offences at the time of the events of 11&nbsp;September&nbsp;2001;</P>

<P>2.&#9;progress of discussions on the proposal for a Directive on insider trading and market manipulation;</P>

<P>3.&#9;progress of the conciliation procedure concerning the proposal for a Directive on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering;</P>

<P>4.&#9;presidency initiatives to improve multilateral cooperation (with the FATF, between national anti-money-laundering units, counter measures against non-cooperation countries).</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Commissioner BOLKESTEIN, for his part, emphasised the importance in the current context of adopting a directive on<B> </B>insider trading and market manipulation, the important role of the CESR (Committee of European Securities Regulators) in investigations into the possible manipulation of the markets linked to the events of 11 September and the key role of the FATF in combating the financing of terrorism.  In that connection, he emphasised that it was important that Member States' delegations adopt a coordinated approach at the meeting in Washington on 30 October 2001.</P>

</B></I></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The Council invites the Commission to prepare a report on the benefits and challenges of globalisation, and possible responses to those challenges.  The report should focus on financial globalisation and review ways to promote and finance development.  The Council would welcome receiving a first interim report in time for its meeting on 14&nbsp;December 2001.  This interim report should consist of a detailed plan indicating the various topics for current and future study.  It should already contain advanced information on financial issues, and as much as possible on development-related issues.  Understandably, the latter requires wider consultations with relevant bodies.  The final report would be welcomed by the end of February 2002.  The interim and final reports shall be discussed by the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) prior to their presentation to the Council.</P>

<P>The following areas may be explored; they may be neither exhaustive nor do they constitute a proposal for the structure of the report:</P>

<P>I.&#9;<U>Financial globalisation</P>
</U>
<P>This part of the report could include:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;analysis of the overall benefits of globalisation in various fields (trade, finance and beyond);</P>
<P>2.&#9;analysis of the impact of financial globalisation, including international capital flows, on both developed and developing countries;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>3.&#9;assessment of ongoing initiatives to improve the effectiveness and the resilience of the international financial system and to mitigate volatility in financial markets;</P>
<P>4.&#9;assessment of ongoing initiatives launched by the international community to offset, where necessary, the potential drawbacks/abuses of financial globalisation.</P>

<P>Looking forward, the report could:</P>
<P>1.&#9;look at ways to deepen and accelerate efforts to improve the effectiveness of the international financial system and to counter the potential drawbacks/abuses of financial globalisation;</P>
<P>2.&#9;analyse advantages and disadvantages of the creation of a tax on currency transactions, including the "Tobin tax" and similar proposals;</P>
<P>3.&#9;study additional initiatives in the fight against the financing of terrorism and against money laundering, including means to improve the transparency of corporate vehicles.</P>
</DIR>

<P>II.&#9;<U>Development</P>

</U><P>This part of the report should analyse the various existing instruments contributing to development processes and reduction of inequalities, which are important for the objectives mentioned above (fight against the financing of terrorism, fight against money laundering, financial stability, etc.):</P>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;efficiently targeted and delivered overseas development aid (fulfilment of the 0.7% GDP objective) provided at the multilateral, the EU (with a strong focus on the ways to improve EU assistance to third countries) and, to the extent necessary at Member States' (bilateral aid) levels, with a view to preparing a coordinated Union approach on the financial aspects of development aid for the United Nations Conference to be held in Monterey in March&nbsp;2002; </P>

<P>2.&#9;debt reduction, including the HIPC initiative;</P>
<P>3.&#9;the role of trade and market access for development;</P>
<P>4.&#9;the role of direct foreign investment, etc.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The Commission could also look into the comparative pros and cons of other sources for financing development, including tax devices (on currency transactions, carbon emissions, arms exports, "De-Tax", etc.).</P>

This network shall start functioning from early December 2001.</P>

<P>The Council invited members of the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) to appoint one participant from each Member State to the changeover information network. The nominated participant shall provide information concerning the progress of its Member State regarding the changeover at frequent intervals, according to a short questionnaire. A coordinating team located in the European Commission, in collaboration with the Secretariat of the EFC, will compile and assess the information provided. </P>

<P>On the basis of the information provided by the network and other sources, the Council invited the EFC, in close coordination with the ECB's Cash Changeover Committee (CashCo), to stand ready to advise the ECOFIN Council, including through the preparation of draft terms of reference to respond to possible problems with the euro changeover, throughout the period of the introduction of euro bank notes and coins."</P>

</B></U><P>The Council took note of a presentation by the Commission of the main features of its proposals for the air transport sector discussed in more detail at the Telecommunications/Transport Council meeting on 16 October 2001.</P>

<P>In its presentation, the Commission referred in particular to the agreement reached at the informal meeting in Li&egrave;ge on the principles on which national intervention would be based with regard to insurance.  Intervention would in principle be acceptable for a period of one month after which the situation would be reviewed.  The Commission suggested that general aid should be allowed exclusively to compensate for the direct effects of the closure of United States' airspace during the four days immediately after 11 September.</P>

<P>Emphasising the need to act in concert with the Transport Council on the Commission proposals, the Council reaffirmed the principles agreed by the Ecofin Ministers in Li&egrave;ge, notably the need to avoid providing general aid to non-profitable airline companies, the desire to limit as far as possible the period during which Member States provide insurance and the need to encourage the insurance provision market to resume operation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In this connection, several Ministers stressed the need to ensure that the premiums requested by Member States be high enough to ensure a speedy return of insurers and insured to the market.  The Council also proposed examining insurance measures in place in the Member States on a monthly basis and setting an end-of-December deadline for their definitive expiry.  The President noted a very clear preference for as speedy a return as possible to commercial insurance based on proper operation of the market.</P>

<P>Regarding compensation for the closure of United States' air space, Ministers confirmed that their approach would be restrictive.  Any compensatory intervention should be strictly limited to the direct consequences of the closure and the extent of such intervention should be monitored by the Commission.  In this connection, the Council said that its main concern was to eliminate any possibility of introducing general aid in this sector.</P>

<P>The Council also heard Mr&nbsp;MAYSTADT, President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) outline his Institution's commitments vis-&agrave;-vis the air transport sector with particular reference to that sector's requests for funding.</P>

</B>
<P>The Council adopted the following conclusions on access and benefit-sharing in preparation for the meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Bonn, 22&nbsp;to&nbsp;26&nbsp;October&nbsp;2001):</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"1.&#9;The European Union recognises that access to genetic resources is of critical importance for meeting the food, health and other needs of the growing world population.  It is committed to the achievement of all objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, including the third, namely the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources.  This should contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.</P>

<P>2.&#9;The European Union welcomes Decision V/26 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity convening an Ad hoc Open-ended Working Group on Access and Benefit-sharing with a mandate to develop guidelines and other approaches for submission to the VI Conference of the Parties and welcomes the work of the Panel of Experts on Access and Benefit-sharing.</P>

<P>3.&#9;The European Union agrees that the guidelines on access and benefit-sharing being developed should go together with a range of other approaches such as codes of conduct, indicators, model agreements as well as sectoral guidelines developed by other organisations.</P>

<P>4.&#9;The European Union looks forward to the discussions which will take place in the above-mentioned Working Group and thanks Germany for having offered to host the meeting of the Group in Bonn, from 22 to 26 October 2001.</P>

<P>5.&#9;The European Union believes that the guidelines should aim at assisting Parties and relevant stakeholders in developing, as appropriate, legislative, administrative and policy measures as well as contractual arrangements on Access and Benefit-sharing.  The guidelines should facilitate access for users by increasing transparency, legal certainty and reducing transaction costs.  At the same time, they should endorse and further elaborate on the principles of prior informed consent and mutually agreed terms and be a means of facilitating providers in obtaining an equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.  Such benefits can be monetary and non-monetary and can be shared in the short, medium and long term.</P>

<P>6.&#9;The scope of the guidelines should be wide: all genetic resources covered by the Convention on Biological Diversity and associated traditional knowledge, innovations and practices should be included.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>7.&#9;The European Union thinks that the guidelines should be flexible enough to suit Access and Benefit-sharing arrangements by different users and for different uses.  Therefore, a fine balance should be sought in the level of detail to be reflected in the guidelines. </P>

<P>8.&#9;The guidelines will be voluntary in nature.  However, there should be a strong commitment to developing guidelines which would meet the requirements of the Convention on Biological Diversity and would be acceptable to Parties and stakeholders.</P>

<P>9.&#9;The European Union believes that it is important to ensure coherence and mutual supportiveness between the guidelines and other ongoing developments such as in the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the World Trade Organisation.</P>

<P>10.&#9;In particular, the Multilateral System, which is under discussion in the revision of the Food and Agriculture Organisation International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture should be taken into account.  Moreover, the development of guidelines regarding aspects which relate to the protection of traditional knowledge and intellectual property should take account of and be mutually supportive with the work of the World Intellectual Property Organisation Inter-Governmental Committee.</P>

<P>11.&#9;The European Union considers that the full and proper implementation of Article 15 is very important and encourages the Commission and its Member States to review its policy, administrative and legislative measures in the light of the outcome of the VI Conference of the Parties in April 2002.</P>

<P>12.&#9;On this basis, the European Union encourages the Ad hoc Working Group to develop and endorse a set of draft guidelines and other approaches on Access and Benefit-sharing to be submitted for final discussion and adoption to the VI Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to be held in The Hague from 8 to 19 April 2002."</P>
