RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA

The Council  heard a  statement by  Jean KAHN,  Chairman of  the Consultative
Commission on Racism  and Xenophobia, on the outcome of the feasibility study
conducted by  the  Commission on  the  setting up  of  a European  Monitoring
Centre on  Racism and  Xenophobia, in  accordance with the  request from  the
Cannes European Council.

The Commission's report will  be submitted directly to the Florence  European
Council.

The Council thanked Mr  KAHN for his personal action and that  of the members
of the Commission in the interests of an ethical Europe and for his  tireless
efforts to combat racism and xenophobia.

The  Council instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to study this
dossier in preparation for  the Florence European Council and to  report back
in time for its next meeting on 10 and 11 June 1996.

RELATIONS WITH MEXICO

Continuing  its discussions  on negotiating  directives for  a  new agreement
with  Mexico,  the  Council  approved  the  Presidency's compromise  proposal
relating to the  aim of this agreement  and the procedures to  be implemented
in order to attain it.

The  Council  therefore  recorded  political  agreement  on  the  negotiating
directives, which would be formally adopted without  delay after finalization
of the text (without further discussion, as an "A" item).

FORMER YUGOSLAVIA - COUNCIL CONCLUSIONS

The Council  held an in-depth discussion  on the implementation of  the peace
process in  Bosnia-Herzogovina  in the  light of  the reports  from the  High
Representative, Carl  Bildt,  the  European Administrator  of  Mostar,  Perez
Casado,  and  the  Presidency's  State  Secretary  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Mr
Ferraris.

The  Union  expresses its  full  support  for the  decision  of the  European
Administrator of  Mostar, Perez Casado,  to set the date  for local elections
at  31 May 1996; it  believes that these elections  should make a substantial
contribution  towards the  town's reunification.  It  has every confidence in
any decisions he  may take in the light of his direct knowledge on the ground
to  ensure that  the objective  of the  proper  conduct of  the elections  is
achieved.

The European Union calls upon all the parties  involved to cooperate fully in
holding free  and orderly elections.   This will also provide  the Union with
the  necessary  elements for  adopting  a decision,  in  compliance with  the
conditions  set  by  the Council  on  22 April,  on continuing  the  European
Union's presence in Mostar as requested by the parties themselves.

The  Council  emphasizes  the  great  importance which  it  attaches  to  the
electoral  process in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  accordance with  the timetable
laid down and in the context of the OSCE's action.

The  Council points to  the importance  of providing the  necessary funds for
the organization of the elections by the OSCE in  the context of an equitable
division of international  effort in support of  the electoral process.   The
Union   will   consider   ways   to   support   the   electoral  process   in
Bosnia-Herzegovina,  particularly   as   regards  the   activities  of   OSCE
observers.   The Council  states its  agreement to  the principle  of a joint
action and instructs  the competent bodies to prepare a draft to be submitted
to it for adoption as soon as possible.

With  a view to ensuring that  the elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina take place
in an  orderly, correct  and safe  fashion, the  Union again  calls upon  the
parties  to implement  the essential  points already identified  by the OSCE.
The  phased  and orderly  return  of refugees  under  safe  conditions is  of
paramount importance here.

The  Union remains  committed to  the aim of  consolidating the Croat-Bosnian
Federation as an essential element of the peace  process and of the integrity
of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.   It welcomes  the undertakings  entered into  by the
parties at  the meeting in Petersberg on  25 April and emphasizes the need to
follow them up with concrete action.

In this connection  the Union expresses concern at  the continued deadlock in
the Republika Srpska,  and would  welcome the emergence  of political leaders
who are prepared to cooperate fully in the implementation of the peace plan.

The Union endorses  the High Representative's decision  to open an office  in
Banja Luka, and the  Commission's decision to post staff there.  In the light
of information from the High Representative, the Union agreed on  the need to
carry  out  reconstruction  projects  to  encourage  the  peace  process  and
reconciliation in the region. 

The Union recalls the undertakings entered into by  the FRY and the Republika
Srpska   regarding   implementation  of   the   Peace  Agreement,   including
cooperation with the International Tribunal.

The  Council noted  the decision  of  the Presidency  and  the Commission  to
postpone the visit by the Presidents of the Council and the  Commission which
was  to have  taken  place on  16 and 17 May 1996,  to  demonstrate the  EU's
approach to  the region's future.   It also reiterated the  Union's hope that
the visit could take  place very soon.  The Council will examine the question
of autonomous  measures in the  light of  that visit  and on the  basis of  a
Commission proposal.

In the  context of  that approach,  the Union is  prepared to  consider -  in
coordination  with  the  High  Representative  -  a  gradual  improvement  in
relations with the FRY  and to take appropriate measures in the  light of the
latter's  attitude,  particularly  as   regards  the  criteria  set   in  the
Presidency's Declaration of  9 April 1996 concerning  recognition of the  FRY
by the EU Member States, the right of return for refugees and  the obligation
to readmit nationals.

The Mid-term  Conference  to  be held  in  Florence on  13  and 14 June  will
provide an opportunity for taking stock of the  progress of the peace process
and economic reconstruction, including  the setting up of the United  Nations
Transitional  Administration in eastern Slavonia, and for drawing conclusions
regarding the Union's attitude over the coming months.

Regarding Croatia's  accession to the  Council of Europe, the Council,  while
confirming  its  support  for  this  step, takes  the  view  that  a  precise
timetable should be established  as regards the undertakings entered into  by
Croatia  with  a  view  to  its  accession.    The Council  proposes that  an
extraordinary  meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe
be held before the summer to take  a decision on this accession in  the light
of the degree of compliance with the aforesaid timetable.

ALBANIA

The Council  was pleased  to note  that the  Commission  would be  submitting
draft directives for negotiations  with Albania with the aim of  concluding a
new agreement  which would represent an  important step along the  road to an
association agreement.

MEDITERRANEAN POLICY

-  EURO-MEDITERRANEAN AGREEMENTS

On the  basis of an oral  report from the Commission, the  Council took stock
of  the  progress of  the  negotiations currently  taking  place with  Egypt,
Jordan and Lebanon and of  developments in the exploratory talks between  the
Commission, the Palestinian Authority and Syria.

The  Commission  also  put  to  the  Council  its  proposal  for  negotiating
directives for a Euro-Mediterranean association agreement with Algeria.

The  Council encouraged the Commission to  work towards a rapid conclusion of
the current negotiations  and to ensure  that the exploratory talks  with the
Palestinian  authority and  Syria resulted  as soon as  possible in proposals
for negotiating directives.

The Council also instructed the Permanent  Representatives Committee to study
the Commission proposals on Algeria with the aim of adopting the  negotiating
directives before the end of June.

-  MEDA REGULATION

The  Council decided  -  with  the abstention  of  Greece  - to  consult  the
European Parliament again  on the text of the  MEDA programme as a  result of
the substantial  changes  to  be made  to  the  original text  on  which  the
European Parliament had delivered its Opinion on 14 December 1995.

The  Council agreed to enter this item  on the agenda for its next meeting on
10 and 11 June with the aim of reaching a conclusion on this subject then.

MIDDLE EAST

Following the informal meeting with Rafic HARIRI, Prime  Minister of Lebanon,
the   Council  reaffirmed   the  Union's   willingness  to   assist  in   the
reconstruction of Lebanon.

In this  context, it instructed  its competent bodies  to prepare a reply  to
the recent United States démarche relating to the Consultative  Group for the
Reconstruction of Lebanon  and a  possible meeting of  a conference with  the
same aim.

The Council took  note of  the Presidency's report  on the recent  journey by
the  Troika  to Cairo,  Amman  and  Beirut  and  of the  very  strong  desire
expressed by  all  discussion partners  at that  time  for Europe  to play  a
greater role in the peace process.

In  preparation  for any  discussions  by the  Florence  European Council  on
achieving  peace in  the Middle  East, the  Council instructed  its competent
bodies to look into  the approach which the Union should adopt  and to report
back in time for its next meeting on 10 and 11 June.

RELATIONS WITH ASIA: CAMBODIA, LAOS, BANGLADESH AND PAKISTAN

The  Council  was  informed by  Vice-President  MARIN  of the  proposals  for
directives  which  the Commission  had just  adopted for  the  negotiation of
cooperation agreements with Cambodia, Laos, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The  Council  stressed  that it  attached  great importance  to strengthening
relations with  these countries, which was  also part of its  Asian strategy,
and  instructed  the  Permanent  Representatives  Committee  to  examine  the
Commission  proposals  with the  aim  of  having the  negotiating  directives
adopted quickly.

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA

The  Council held a discussion on the situation in  Russia.  It took the view
that   the   Russian   Presidential   election   campaign   was   progressing
satisfactorily.   It stressed that  it was of  crucial importance  that these
elections take place and be free and fair,  which would prove that democratic
principles had taken root and become widespread in Russia.

It reiterated  the Union's willingness to make a positive contribution to the
proper conduct of the electoral process  by being involved in observing  them
in collaboration  with  OSCE  bodies  and on  the  basis  of  the  experience
acquired in the Parliamentary elections on 17 December 1995.

Moreover, the  Council is convinced that the  action plan which has just been
approved  and  which  constitutes  the  practical follow-up  to  the  Council
conclusions  of  20 and  21 November 1995 on  the strategy  for  the European
Union's future relations with Russia testifies to the  Union's willingness to
establish  and reinforce  a strong  and fruitful partnership  with Russia and
its  readiness and  determination to  continue to support  the democratic and
economic reforms in that country.

The European  Union is  committed to  establishing a  substantial partnership
with Russia in  order to promote the democratic  and economic reform process,
to  enhance respect  for human  rights, to  consolidate peace,  stability and
security in order to  avoid new dividing lines  in Europe and to  achieve the
full  integration  of  Russia  into  the community  of  free  and  democratic
nations.    To  that  end,  the  European  Union  signed  a  Partnership  and
Cooperation    Agreement   with   Russia   and   the   Council   meeting   on
20 November 1995 adopted conclusions on  the strategy to be followed for  the
European  Union's future  relations with Russia, which  were confirmed by the
Madrid European Council.

On the  basis  of these  priorities, the  European  Union hereby  adopts  the
action plan outlined below.

The action plan will  clearly require close and ongoing coordination  between
the actions  of the European  Community, whose  principal support  instrument
remains the TACIS  programme, and the actions of the Member States and, where
appropriate,  with  the  other  main  donors  in  order   to  ensure  maximum
efficiency in terms of synergy and complementarity.

Action based on this plan will be reviewed if necessary.

I.    Contribution to Russia's democratic reforms

   -  Participation  in  the  international  monitoring  of  the  forthcoming
      presidential elections on the basis of the positive experience acquired
      during  monitoring of the parliamentary  elections on 17 December 1995.
      This  action will  be supported  under  the TACIS  Democracy  Programme
      (TDP).

   -  Implementation of the Agreement  between the European Community and the
      Council of  Europe on  the harmonization  of  Russian legislation  with
      Council  of Europe  rules,  centred  on the  constitutional  and  legal
      aspects of the  legal reform  commitments entered  into by Russia  upon
      accession to the Council of Europe.

   -  Support  for contacts between the  European Parliament, the Parliaments
      of the Member States and  the Russian Parliament to promote the further
      development of democratic institutions and the rule of law.

   -  Support for cooperation between  regions and the twinning  of cities in
      the European Union  and Russia,  notably via  the TACIS "City  Twinning
      Programme".

   -  Support for  the development  of local  and regional  administration in
      Russia by means of  long-term programmes, to  consolidate democracy  at
      local and regional level throughout the country.

   -  Continuation of seminar programmes organized by the  European Community
      and its Member  States for the  benefit of young  decision-makers (MPs,
      businessmen,   senior  administrators,   etc.)   and   journalists   to
      facilitate,  inter alia, direct contact  with European institutions and
      political  and   administrative  systems  in  the  West  and  a  deeper
      understanding of Russia within the EU.

   -  Support for institutions, particularly within the framework of the OSCE
      and the Council of Europe, which organize ad hoc seminars on the rights
      of individuals belonging to  minority groups and on  human rights, open
      to political, legal and administrative leaders.

   -  Support for legal training, particularly through activities  centred on
      the training  of  law  professors  and through  training  and  exchange
      programmes for members of the Russian judiciary.

II.   Economic cooperation

   Contractual relations

   -  Implementation of  the Interim  Agreement -  which entered  into  force
      on 1 February 1996 - ensuring observance of the rights  and obligations
      deriving therefrom.

   -  Ratification  as soon as  possible of  the Partnership  and Cooperation
      Agreement and early accession to that Agreement of the three new Member
      States on the basis of the appropriate instruments.

   -  Negotiation and conclusion of new  bilateral agreements provided for in
      the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.  These  agreements should be
      used to strengthen cooperation and  commercial links with Russia in the
      context of its  transition to a  market economy.   Particular attention
      should  be paid to improving  market access in certain  sectors such as
      financial services.

   -  Proper coordination  between sectoral  negotiations and  specific trade
      questions and the European  Union's general policy as  reflected in its
      strategy.

   Development  of  trade  relations  and  integration  of  Russia  into  the
international economy

   -  Support for  Russia, inter  alia through  the TACIS  programme, in  its
      efforts  to meet  the  conditions  for  accession to  the  WTO  and  to
      integrate fully  into the  international economy.  In  this connection,
      the Community will attach particular importance to Russia's meeting the
      obligations regarding the liberalization of trade policy.

   -  Support for  Russia's alignment on international standards  and, as far
      as possible, on those of the European Union single market.

   -  Setting up  of studies  to  detect  obstacles to  expanding  trade  and
      investment flows.  Particular attention  should be paid to clarifying a
      whole series of  questions, especially the  impact on the  economies of
      the Union Member States and  the extent to which legislation will  have
      to be aligned, from the point of view both of Russia's accession to the
      WTO and - in the  light of the relevant provisions of  the PCA - of the
      possible introduction of a free-trade area between the EU and Russia.

   -  Regular  assessment,  on  the basis  of  clearly  defined  criteria, of
      Russia's progress towards a market economy.

   -  Creation with Russia of a joint Working Party on Trade Facts which will
      collate factual information on specific  trade questions with a view to
      facilitating the  management of trade  relations between  the Community
      and Russia.  The Council will be kept regularly informed of the work of
      this Working Party.

   Regional cooperation

   -  Promotion of regional cooperation between Russia and its neighbours  in
      accordance  with  the  principles  of  the  OSCE  through a  series  of
      initiatives to:

      . promote  transfrontier cooperation between the new Independent States
        and  the Union  and between  the new  Independent States  and Central
        Europe;

      . strengthen regional cooperation  with Russia in the Baltic Sea region
        by  means, inter alia,  of the  initiative  which the  Commission was
        instructed  to  prepare  further to  the  conclusions  of  the Madrid
        European  Council, in  the Barents  Sea region  and in  the Black Sea
        region;

      . promote  the  development  of  trans-European  transport  and  energy
        networks between Russia and its Central and East European  neighbours
        and with the European Union;

      . continue   selective  assistance   for  the  promotion   of  economic
        cooperation  on a voluntary basis between Russia and the countries of
        Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

   Nuclear energy and nuclear safety

   -  Development  of  programmes,  also  in  the  TACIS framework,  for  the
      approximation  of laws in  the context  of the  Energy Charter  and for
      energy sector reforms with a view, inter alia, to improving the quality
      and safety of the Union's energy supplies (various programmes are under
      way concerning  either Russia  and adjacent  Member States,  or a  more
      regional context in which the full association of Russia is desirable).

   -  Assistance on energy price policy, bearing in mind  the recommendations
      of the  International  Energy  Agency,  with  particular  reference  to
      accountancy and management training.

   -  Further  assistance  to  Russia  in  applying  in  the  nuclear  sector
      internationally agreed principles of nuclear safety taking into account
      the outcome of the  nuclear summit in Moscow.   To that end, the  Union
      will support, in particular,  the independent regulation of the nuclear
      sector,  together   with  improvements   in  the   safety  of   nuclear
      installations, including short-term improvements in those installations
      most at risk,  with a view to  closing them down  as soon as  possible.
      The  Union's   assistance  will   also  include   the  preparation   of
      decommissioning  operations including  fuel cycle and  waste management
      aspects.

   -  Willingness  to  consider  providing  on-the-spot  emergency assistance
      should Russia so request.

   -  Encouragement  to Russia  to  ratify  the International  Convention  on
      Nuclear Safety  and  to  adhere to  the  1993  amendments  made  to the
      London Convention which  ban the dumping  of radioactive  waste at sea,
      and to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.

   -  Support for the objective of  a high degree of nuclear safety and sound
      management of pipelines,  both of which,  inter alia, are  essential to
      the prevention of ecological disasters.

   Environment

   -  Continued support  for Russia in the field of the environment based, as
      far as  TACIS is  concerned, on the  possibilities afforded by  the new
      Regulation.  In this connection, particular importance will be given to
      the strengthening of institutions, to legislation and to training.

      On a general level, special attention will also be given to cooperation
      in combating pollution in a transboundary context.

   -  Environmental considerations  will also  be taken into account  when it
      comes  to   designing  and  implementing   assistance  programmes,   in
      particular in the TACIS framework. 

   -  All the attention necessary  will also be given  to initiatives already
      proposed or likely  to be  proposed at  regional level,  such as  those
      already being prepared for the Baltic region.

   Modernization of the production system

   -  Help to make  Russian businesses more competitive.   With this in view,
      the  introduction  of   modern  information   technologies  should   be
      encouraged   and,  in particular   through   TACIS,  the   training  of
      businessmen  and  executive  staff  to develop  the  competitiveness of
      undertakings.

      Particular attention  should  continue  to be  paid  to  assisting  the
      introduction of  an effective  social policy  to back  up the  economic
      restructuring process.

   -  Particular attention will  be given - inter alia in the TACIS programme
      and in  the context  of the action  already undertaken by  the European
      Union to support the  privatization process - to  the restructuring and
      setting up of undertakings, and of a modern banking  system and capital
      market.

   -  Assistance for  Russia's efforts to  create an  environment capable  of
      developing both  national and foreign investment.   In this connection,
      particular importance  will  be  given  to assistance  centred  on  the
      improvement of  taxation,  the  introduction  of  modern  standards  of
      accounting and auditing and proper legal protection for investors.  

   -  Support for local and regional  economic development in Russia in order
      to  consolidate  progress  towards  a  market  economy  throughout  the
      country.

   -  Promotion  of industrial cooperation, for  example by encouraging small
      and medium-sized undertakings  in the  European Union  to set up  joint
      ventures in  Russia, in particular through  the Joint Venture Promotion
      Scheme.

   -  Encouragement of more active competition policies in Russia with a view
      to reducing the importance of monopolies.  

   -  Support for  cooperation  programmes  in  the  field  of  research  and
      development.     Preservation  of Russia's  potential for  research and
      development  in  the  field  of  basic  science  and  encouragement  of
      cooperation in high-tech industries.

   -  Organization  of  round  tables  between  European  Union  and  Russian
      businessmen  with   the  aim  of   strengthening  direct   contacts  in
      professional areas of common interest.

   Humanitarian aid

   -  Further provision  of humanitarian  aid through  the Community  and its
      Member States as  necessary.  The European Union will ensure that there
      is proper coordination between humanitarian  aid and the other forms of
      aid provided by the European Union.

III.  Cooperation in the field of Justice and Home Affairs

   -  Action to  combat  organized crime,  particularly  drug-related  crime,
      including money laundering and action to combat terrorism.  Cooperation
      to prevent the diversion of chemical precursors.
      Illegal economic  activities, including  corruption, counterfeiting and
      illegal   transactions  in  various  goods   should  also  be  covered.
      Cooperation could  take the  form of regular exchanges  of information,
      having due  regard to  national and  international legislation  on data
      protection,  the  setting  up  of  a  network  of  contact  points  and
      participation in seminars.

   -  Action  to combat  illegal  immigration and  cooperation on  asylum and
      readmission policy.   Priority  in  this  context should  be  given  to
      preparation and follow-up of  the Regional Conference which  is to take
      place in  Geneva in  May 1996 concerning  the problem  of refugees  and
      displaced persons in the CIS countries.

   -  Cooperation   on  mutual   judicial   assistance,  in   particular   by
      establishing a network of contact points.

   -  In putting cooperation in  these areas into effect,  any duplication of
      Council of Europe initiatives will be avoided.

IV.   Security in Europe

   -  Initiatives to develop more  contacts within the framework of  existing
      mechanisms between  specialist working parties  and Russian  experts in
      the field  of  security,  covering  relevant  aspects  of  disarmament,
      non-proliferation,  arms export  controls and  conflict  prevention and
      management. 

   -  Further cooperation with Russia in  the elaboration of a security model
      for the Europe of the 21st century, in preparation  for the OSCE summit
      due to take place in December 1996. 

   -  Initiatives  to strengthen the role played by  the OSCE in Chechnya, in
      particular in order  to give tangible support to the  activities of the
      "Assistance Group"  in Grozny in carrying out its mandate and to stress
      the importance  of its  role in  seeking a  negotiated solution  to the
      conflict.

   -  Measures to develop existing cooperation between the EU and Russia with
      a view to  preventing  and   suppressing  illegal  traffic  in  nuclear
      material,  particularly as a follow-up to the  conclusions of the Essen
      European  Council (9  and 10 December 1994),  and  bearing in  mind the
      Moscow Conference on nuclear  safety, especially the ideas  put forward
      in the "Action plan to prevent illegal traffic". 

   -  Support for Russia's  efforts to meet  its commitments in the  field of
      disarmament in order to comply with the international agreements on the
      matter, for example, promoting the speedy ratification by Russia of the
      Convention on chemical weapons.

   -  Continued European Community support for the International  Science and
      Technology Centre (ISTC-Moscow).

   -  Continued promotion  of information  activities, particularly  those of
      the Member States,  with a view  to outlining  EU policies on security,
      and  sponsoring  of conferences  and  debates with  Russian  university
      institutions.

   -  Projects, particularly within  the context of the  TACIS programme, for
      the conversion  of Russian military  industries and  the retraining  of
      demobilized Soviet army  personnel, as well  as in  the wider field  of
      relations between the civilian and military spheres.  Continued support
      for the  Moscow School  of  Political Studies  and the  development  of
      civilian responsibility for security issues could also be considered.

V.    Foreign Policy

   -  Strengthening of the political dialogue with Russia, in accordance with
      the provisions  of the Partnership  and Cooperation  Agreement.   Under
      that  heading,  organization of  meetings between  Russian  experts and
      EU working parties, according  to requirements  and on  the basis of  a
      programme to be drawn up by each Presidency.

   -  In the context of the political dialogue, organization of consultations
      with  Russian  representatives on  the eve  of  important international
      political events.

   -  Exchange  of experience on the  conduct of foreign  affairs, especially
      exchanges   on  foreign   policy  formulation   and   foreign  ministry
      organization, for example, legal departments.

   -  Creation  of   a  training  programme   covering  the   European  Union
      (institutional and legal  structures, development, etc.)  for diplomats
      and other Russian officials, drawing on TACIS and the resources of  the
      Member States (e.g. training procedures for diplomats).

   -  Increased  consultation  with  Russia  on  questions  relating  to  the
      peaceful settlement  of disputes in  the context  of the  OSCE and  the
      United Nations.

   -  Initiation of discussions  with Russia on  the concept and  practice of
      preventive diplomacy.

COUNCIL CONCLUSIONS

The  Council was  very interested to hear  Vice-President Brittan's report on
the recent progress of the  preparatory work for the Singapore  Conference to
be held from 9 to 13 December 1996.

The  Council stressed  that it  attached great  importance to the  success of
this  Conference for  the  operation of  the WTO  and the  multilateral trade
system.

This matter is  linked to possible  multilateral initiatives to  be taken  by
the European Union to secure a consistent market  access strategy as outlined
in a Commission communication on 14 February 1996.

The various points  in that communication have already been examined in depth
by  the  Article 113 Committee  and  conclusions  reached  which the  Council
endorsed; in those conclusions,  the Commission is called upon to  defend the
interests of the Community and its Member States.

Work  should  continue to  enable  the  European Union  to  prepare  a common
position   on  all   the  proposals  submitted  by   the  Commission  in  its
communication on a market  access strategy, in particular in preparation  for
the Singapore Conference, and to play a dynamic and constructive role  in the
process of preparing for that Conference.

These  matters  should be  discussed  in greater  detail  at the  forthcoming
Council meeting on 10 June 1996.

RELATIONS WITH NIGER - COUNCIL CONCLUSIONS

The  Council noted  with satisfaction  that  a constitutional  referendum was
held yesterday in Niger.

It decided that as soon as  the results of the referendum had  been announced
and  the ban  on political  parties lifted, cooperation  between the European
Union and Niger could be progressively resumed.

Initially this resumption will involve:

-  support for the electoral process,
-  aid  for structural adjustment:  at this stage  such aid  will be directed
   exclusively towards the most pressing needs in the social sectors.

The Council  decided  to return  to this  question  at its  next meeting  and
examine  whether the  conditions were fulfilled  for resuming  European Union
cooperation with Niger.

DECLARATION ON THE LIBERIAN BOAT PEOPLE

The  European Union  is  deeply  concerned  about  the  serious  humanitarian
situation  created by  the continuing fighting in  Monrovia and condemns acts
of violence  towards the  civil population  and the  harassment to which  aid
operations are subject.

While recognizing  the tremendous  efforts already  made by the  neighbouring
countries  to  help  the hundreds  of  thousands  of Liberian  refugees,  the
Council deplores the fact that thousands of people crammed  together in boats
in perilous conditions are still seeking a  port which will accept them.  For
humanitarian  reasons,  it appeals  to the  neighbouring  countries  to grant
shelter,  even if  only  temporarily, to  the  victims  of the  fighting  and
affirms  its  willingness to  provide humanitarian  aid to  cover  their most
pressing needs.

The  Council calls on  all factions  in Liberia to  stop fighting immediately
and  put the peace  process back on  track so  that further suffering  can be
avoided.

RELATIONS WITH SWITZERLAND - PROGRESS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS

The Council  assessed current progress  in the  negotiations being  conducted
with  Switzerland   in  the  following  areas:   research  and  technological
development,   agriculture,  mutual  recognition  of  conformity  assessment,
public contracts, free movement of persons, inland and air transport.

It  began  by  stressing  yet  again  the  importance   of  completing  these
negotiations as soon as possible so as to  develop the European Union's long-
standing close and mutually beneficial relations with Switzerland.

The  Council  accordingly noted  with interest  the latest  proposals  by the
Swiss Federal  Council of 3 April 1996 based  on a phased approach that could
inject  a new dynamic  into the  negotiations.  It  expressed satisfaction at
the progress achieved hitherto, but nevertheless noted that  there were still
problems  of varying  degrees of  seriousness.  The  most important concerned
free movement of persons and transport.

On the subject of  free movement of persons it was necessary in particular to
move  on  from the  principle  already accepted  by  Switzerland of  national
treatment  in accordance  with the acquis communautaire  to an examination of
the  detailed  arrangements for  full attainment  of such  free  movement, by
means of a phased approach.

As regards inland  transport, it should in particular be ensured that as soon
as  the agreement  comes into  force  and  thereafter non-discriminatory  and
proportional taxation is applied  in accordance with Community law in  force,
taking account of  the level of road charges applied by adjacent countries so
as  to avoid deviation of  traffic, and that 40  tonne lorries have access to
Swiss towns  and cities.   The Council noted  that transport issues would  be
discussed by the Transport Council on 17 and 18 June 1996.

The Council  consequently asked  the Commission to  continue the negotiations
with Switzerland in close collaboration with the Member States  and to report
back at its July meeting, with  the objective of reaching as soon as possible
a  positive outcome  based on  the principles  of  the global  nature of  the
negotiations,  a  balance   between  the   different  sectors  and   parallel
shouldering  of commitments  in  accordance with  the directives  approved in
1994.

ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES - DECLARATION BY THE EUROPEAN UNION

At  the closure  of  the  Review Conference  of  the  States Parties  to  the
Convention on Certain Convential Weapons, the European Union  recalls that it
has,  over  the  last  years, redoubled  its  efforts  to  combat  the severe
consequences caused to civilians  by the indiscriminate use of landmines,  in
particular anti-personnel mines.

The European Union, which had adopted  in May 1995 a joint action in order to
reconfirm  its commitment  to the  objective of  an overall  strengthening of
Protocol II  of  the  CCW, considers  that  the  achievements of  the  Review
Conference  (such  as  the  extension  of  the  scope   of  Protocol II;  the
strengthening of  restrictions on  the use  of mines;  the new and  immediate
prohibitions   regarding   transfers;   the   provisions   on   technological
cooperation  and  assistance;  the  regular  review  mechanism, etc.),  taken
together, are significant steps forward, both in terms  of landmines protocol
itself and of the development of international humanitarian law.

The  European  Union  however  underlines  that the  results  of  the  Review
Conference fall short  of its expectations and of  some of the goals  set out
in its joint action.   In particular, the  EU should have liked an  effective
and binding verification mechanism and no periods of  deferral of compliance,
or at least much shorter ones.

The  European  Union  is  convinced  that  the  conclusion   of  this  Review
Conference  is only  the beginning  of a  challenging process  which requires
constant  and widespread  efforts and  persistence in order  to fully achieve
its basic humanitarian objectives.  The European Union  will continue to seek
solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel landmines  and will strive
towards   the  goal   of  their   eventual  elimination   as  stated   in  UN
Resolution 50/70 (0).   In  the meantime,  the Member States  of the European
Union will seek early ratification of the amended Protocol II, as well  as of
the new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons, and  will take urgent steps to
ensure  their  compliance with  all  the provisions  of  these two  protocols
pending their entry into force.

The European Union will also  continue to lend active efforts with  a view to
achieving universal adherence  to the CCW, since  its objectives can  only be
effectively attained through implementation  of its provisions by  the widest
number of States and parties to conflicts.

Furthermore,  the  European  Union recalls  its  determination to  pursue its
contribution  to  the  international mine  clearance  efforts.   The  EU  has
already  contributed to  the UN Voluntary Trust  Fun, financing in particular
projects  in  Angola and  Mozambique  as well  as  in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and
Croatia.   In addition,  the EU will  consider the possibility  of conducting
specific  demining  actions and  will  continue to  seek to  that  effect the
contribution  of  the  WEU to  the  elaboration  and implementation  of  such
actions.

The  Central  and  Eastern European  countries  associated with  the European
Union  (Bulgaria, the  Czech Republic,  Estonia, Hungary,  Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia) and the associated countries Cyprus  and Malta, as
well  as the EFTA  countries members of  the EEA,  Iceland, Liechtenstein and
Norway, align themselves with this statement.

ASSOCIATION COUNCILS WITH CYPRUS AND MALTA

The Council  defined the positions  which the Union  would adopt at the  17th
Association  Council  meeting with  Cyprus and  the  9th  Association Council
meeting with Malta, both scheduled  for the morning of 14 May (Press Releases
CE-M 602/96 Presse 144 and CE-CY 705/96 Presse 145).

In  addition,  it  finalized the  European  Union's  position for  the  joint
ministerial meeting with Cyprus  and Malta in  the context of the  structured
dialogue, which was  also scheduled for the  morning of  14 May.  The  points
for discussion at that  meeting relate to the  procedures for the  structured
dialogue,  the follow-up  to the Barcelona Conference,  the Middle East Peace
Process, the former Yugoslavia and the Intergovernmental Conference.

3rd MINISTERIAL MEETING OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE

The Council meeting  coincided with the  3rd ministerial meeting of  the IGC,
which dealt with subjects relating to flexibility and  differentiation in the
integration process and the effectiveness and balance of  the institutions in
preparation for enlargement.

The ministerial meeting was  preceded by a meeting with Mr HÄNSCH,  President
of the European Parliament,  accompanied by Mrs  GUIGOU and Mr BROK,  Members
of the European  Parliament, which gave rise  to a  discussion on the  topics
for the IGC ministerial meeting.

MISCELLANEOUS DECISIONS

(Adopted without  discussion.   In the  case of legislative  acts, any  votes
against or  abstentions are  indicated.   Decisions involving any  statements
which the Council has decided may  be released to the public are  marked with
an asterisk;  the  statements in  question  may be  obtained from  the  Press
Office.)

Kazakhstan - conclusion of the Interim Agreement

The  Council decided to  conclude the  Interim Agreement on  trade and trade-
related matters signed on 5 December 1995.

It  also gave  its assent  and prior  approval so  that the  Commission could
proceed  with   the  parallel  conclusion  of   the  Interim  Agreement  with
Kazakhstan on behalf of the ECSC and the EAEC respectively.

The Interim  Agreement will make it  possible to apply the  provisions of the
trade  section   of  the  Partnership  and   Cooperation  Agreement,  pending
completion  of the  ratification  procedures  for that  Agreement,  which was
signed in Brussels on 23 January 1995.

Associated CCEE - Community quotas and ceilings

The Council amended Regulations

-  (EC) No 2178/95 opening and providing  for the administration of Community
   tariff  quotas and ceilings  for certain  industrial and  fishery products
   originating  in  Estonia,  Latvia  and  Lithuania,  and  establishing  the
   detailed provisions for adapting these quotas and ceilings;

-  (EC) No 1798/94 opening and providing  for the administration of Community
   tariff  quotas for certain agricultural  products originating in Bulgaria,
   the  Czech   Republic,  Hungary,   Poland,  Romania   and  Slovakia,   and
   establishing  the detailed  provisions  for adapting  these  quotas (1994-
   1997).

Pending completion of  the negotiations  with the CCEE  on the adjustment  of
the Europe  and free trade agreements following the enlargement of the Union,
the aim of  these amendments is to  grant autonomous concessions in  the form
of  tariff  ceilings  to  Latvia  and  Lithuania  for  textile  products  and
concessions  in the form of tariff  quotas to the three  Baltic States and to
Poland for  certain  fishery products,  and to  open  two tariff  quotas  for
potatoes  for Estonia.    Lastly,  the changes  provide  for  the opening  of
Community  tariff  quotas  in favour  of  Bulgaria  and Romania  for  certain
agricultural products.

TACIS Regulation - conciliation with the European Parliament

The Council decided  to accede to  the European Parliament's request  for the
opening  of  a  conciliation  procedure  -  in  accordance   with  the  Joint
Declaration of 1975 relating to acts with important  financial implications -
on the  proposal for a Regulation  concerning the provision of  assistance to
economic  reform  and recovery  in the  New Independent  States  and Mongolia
(TACIS).

The Council hopes that this procedure  can be concluded as soon  as possible,
to enable it to adopt the Regulation without delay.

San Marino

The  Council agreed  to two draft  Decisions -  to be approved  by the EC-San
Marino Cooperation  Committee  -   the  purpose  of  which is  to  adopt  the
procedures  for  making available  to  the San  Marino  Exchequer the  import
duties collected by the Community on behalf of the Republic of San Marino.

They  relate more  specifically  to introducing  an administrative  procedure
with  regard  to the  establishment and  accounting treatment  of  the import
duties collected by the Community on behalf of the Republic of San Marino.
  
Principality of Andorra

In approving  the results of the negotiations,  the Council decided to sign a
Protocol to the  Agreement between the EEC  and the Principality  of Andorra,
the  purpose of  which is  to adjust  that Agreement  to take account  of the
enlargement of the European Union.

Thailand - consultations under GATT Article XXIII

The Council adopted the Decision concerning  the conclusion of the results of
consultations with Thailand under GATT Article XXIII.

The consultations  resulted in  an Agreement in  the form  of an Exchange  of
Letters  providing for  the opening of autonomous  Community tariff quotas on
broken  rice and manioc starch with effect  from 1 April 1996.  The Agreement
means  that the  current consultations  under Article XXIII of  the 1994 GATT
will be suspended.

Directive on protection against ionizing radiation *

The  Council   formally  adopted  the  Directive  laying  down  basic  safety
standards for the  protection of the health of workers and the general public
against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation.

The Euratom Treaty provides for basic standards to be  established within the
Community for the protection of the health of workers and the  general public
against the dangers arising  from ionizing radiation.  These basic  standards
were set for  the first time in  1959 in a  Council Directive and  amended on
several occasions to take account of the development  of scientific knowledge
concerning  radiation   protection.    The  current  version  of  the  "basic
standards" dates back to 1980 with some amendments, chiefly to  the technical
annexes, made in 1984.

The  aim of  the  Directive  adopted  today  is  to  reinforce  the  existing
provisions on  the subject,  in particular  by reducing the  dose limits,  to
ensure  that  the  general  public  and workers  receive  the  best  possible
protection against the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.

The  Directive  also  aims   to  maintain  technical  consistency   with  the
recommendations of  international  organizations  such as  the  WHO  and  the
IAEA/OECD.  Lastly, it  adapts the existing legislation to the  new situation
created by completion of the internal market.

Considerable  account  has  been  taken  in drafting  the  Directive  of  the
recommendations of  the International  Commission on  Radiological Protection
(ICRP).

The  Directive  applies  to all  practices  involving  a risk  from  ionizing
radiation  emanating from  an artificial  source or from  a natural radiation
source  in cases where  natural radionuclides are  or have  been processed in
view of their radioactive, fissile or fertile properties.

Emphasis should be placed particularly  on the following provisions  relating
to 

-  dose limits:

   -  for exposed  workers, the  effective dose  is to  be 100  millisieverts
      ("mSv")  in  a  consecutive  five year  period,  subject to  a  maximum
      effective dose of 50 mSv in  any single year.  Member States may decide
      an annual amount.

   -  for members of the public, the limit for effective  dose is to be 1 mSv
      in a year.  However, in special  circumstances, a higher effective dose
      may  be authorized  in a single  year, provided  that the  average over
      five consecutive years does not exceed 1 mSv per year.

-  natural radiation sources:

   -  the provisions in Title VII  of the Directive apply  to work activities
      not covered  by the general scope within which  the presence of natural
      radiation sources leads  to a significant  increase in the  exposure of
      workers or of members  of the public  which cannot be disregarded  from
      the radiation protection point of view; 

-  radiological emergencies:

   -  the   provisions  in  Title VI  apply  to   intervention  in  cases  of
      radiological emergencies or in cases of lasting exposure resulting from
      the after-effects of a radiological emergency or a past or old practice
      or work activity.

Directive on investor-compensation schemes

Noting that  it was impossible to  accept all eight amendments  to its common
position  voted  by  the  European  Parliament  on  second   reading  at  its
March 1996  part-session, the  Council  decided to  convene the  Conciliation
Committee in accordance with Article 189b(3) of the Treaty.

The Council adopted its common position on 23 October 1995.

Directive on cross-border credit transfers

Noting  that it  was impossible  to accept  all  14 amendments to  its common
position  voted  by  the  European  Parliament  on  second   reading  at  its
March 1996  part-session, the  Council  decided to  convene the  Conciliation
Committee in accordance with Article 189b(3) of the Treaty.

The Council adopted its common position on 4 December 1995.

Directive on  the right  to vote and  to stand  as a  candidate in  municipal
elections

The  Council  amended  Directive 94/80/EC  of  19 December 1994  laying  down
detailed  arrangements for the exercise of the  right to vote and to stand as
a candidate  in municipal elections  by citizens of  the Union residing in  a
Member State  of  which  they are  not  nationals,  to take  account  of  the
accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.

The purpose of the amendment  is to adjust the Annex  to the Directive so  as
to provide a  reference to  the basic local  government units of  these three
countries.
